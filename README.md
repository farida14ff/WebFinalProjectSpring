# Spring Boot "Library Management System"

## About the Service

The service is just a simple Library Management system REST service. It uses MySQL database to store the data. 
You can use this sample service to understand the conventions and configurations that allow you to create a DB-backed RESTful service. Once you understand and get comfortable with the sample app you can add your own services following the same patterns as the sample service.
